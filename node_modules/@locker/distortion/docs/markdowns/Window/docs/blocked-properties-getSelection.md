## window.getSelection

The [`window.getSelection()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/getSelection) method of the Document interface returns a Selection object representing the range of text selected by the user, or the current position of the caret.

Malicious code can use this with `document.execCommand('selectAll')` to copy the entire visible contents of a web page. 

### Distorted Behavior

This distortion blocks access to `document.getSelection()` and `window.getSelection()`.
