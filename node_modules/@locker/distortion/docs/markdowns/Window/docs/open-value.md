## window.open

The [`window.open()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) method loads the specified resource into a new or existing browsing context with the specified name. If the name doesn't exist, then a new browsing context is opened in a new tab or a new window, and the specified resource is loaded into it.

This new browsing context isnâ€™t sandboxed properly and malicious code can access system mode, so Lightning Web Security distorts the `window` object returned.

### Distorted Behavior

The returned `window` object has the same distortions applied to it as the originating sandbox.
