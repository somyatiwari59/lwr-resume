   - Prevents double border on mixed/shadow mode: 
   This is added because we have 'slds-accordion__list-item' from the host and inside the component (within the shadow boundary). This will cause double border on mixed/shadow mode.
   The code below will remove the border coming from the host and keep the border from shadow boundary.  
   - Added '!important' as a last resort as user agent style sheet will always win over our own styles.
