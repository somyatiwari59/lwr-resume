# i18nCldrOptions

This module gets generated from [Localizer's i18n-cldr-options](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/Globalization/localizerjs/tree/master/packages/%40localizer/i18n-cldr-options) which is maintained by the globalization team.

We then expose it as part of lightning for internal usage on the platform. This module is also part of our NPM distribution.
